[Online consensus](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/embed-a-youtube-video) says Youtube videos cannot be embedded in Github. So all my screenshots links to YouTube.

Audio samples taken from F. Deakin and N. Franglen

I've tried my weather API translation during different weather scenarios and as a result, different audio files play. The YouTube video shows Bushwick when the windspeed was greater than 1 mile per hour, the temperature was 55 degrees, there was no rain, no clouds, and no storm. As a result of these conditions, the second audio file "BellDrums.wav" plays.
