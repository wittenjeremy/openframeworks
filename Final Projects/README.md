[Online consensus](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/embed-a-youtube-video) says Youtube videos cannot be embedded in Github. So all my screenshots links to YouTube.

## 1. Narrative
[![alt text](https://github.com/wittenjeremy/openframeworks/blob/master/Image%20files/trumpscreenshot.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3YaRhRx-1c)
I made multiple changes to my narrative following feedback I received during the in-class crits. These changes include: (1) Adding multiple audio files that correspond to different walls, (2) Adding maps to the background to give further narrative context, (3) Adding an explosion sound to the end to give the narrative a distinct 'ending,' (4) Adjusting the speed and angles in order to improve narrative quality, and (5) Adding a sinister-sounding backing track to add to the ominous quality of the narrative. I decided to use the concept of "walls" symbolically. Of course Trump is not building walls around the entire country, but the audio clips show him discussing Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union with antagonistic language. As Trump continues his antagonism, the box gets smaller and smaller and the audio becomes increasingly muddled and messy. Eventually the box becomes so small that it explodes and Trump is ejected from the screen.

## 2. Translation

I've tried my weather API translation during different weather scenarios and as a result, different audio files play. The YouTube video shows Bushwick when the windspeed was greater than 1 mile per hour, the temperature was 55 degrees, there was no rain, no clouds, and no storm. As a result of these conditions, the second audio file "BellDrums.wav" plays.

### Settings
#### 1) A clear, sunny day: 
Wind is less than 5mph, no clouds, temperature between 50 and 70 degrees, no rain, no storm within 5 miles

#### 2) A clear day with some wind: 
Wind is more than 5mph, no clouds, temperature between 50 and 70 degrees, no rain, no storm within 5 miles

#### 3) A cloudy day with wind: 
Wind is more than 5mph, clouds, temperature between 50 and 70 degrees, no rain, no storm within 5 miles

#### 4) A cold or hot day with wind and clouds but no rain: 
Wind is more than 5mph, clouds, temperature either below 50 or above 70 degrees, no rain, no storm within 5 miles

#### 5) A cold or hot day with clouds, wind, and rain: 
Wind is more than 5mph, clouds, temperature either below 50 or above 70 degrees, rain, no storm within 5 miles

#### 6) A cold or hot day with clouds, wind, rain, and a storm: 
Wind is more than 5mph, clouds, temperature either below 50 or above 70 degrees, rain, a storm is between 0 and 5 miles away
