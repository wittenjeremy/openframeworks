# Project 1
## Narrative
My narrative will use four symbolic elements to provide a commentary on dreams versus everyday life and the ways in which these two things can affect our happiness and sadness. Dreams will be represented with the symbol of a balloon. Everyday life will be represented with the symbol of a house. Happiness and sadness will be represented with smiling and frowning faces respectively. This four elements will interact with each other in different ways in order to provide a commentary on realizing our dreams and realizing our own happiness.

## Visualization
I will use darksky weather API to create a representation with sound and color. I intend to use the numerical weather data to correspond to specific pitches and specific colors. Since weather is described with a base-10 system of numbers, I will use ten unique pitches and ten unique colors, both of which will correspond to the final digit in a particular degree in fahrenheit. For example, 20 degrees fahrenheit and 30 degrees fahreinheit will generate the same pitch and the same color because 0 is the final digit in both 20 and 30. I will then use specific geographic locations to generate 12-note melodies and color changing visualizations by assembling their average monthly degree in fahrenheit from January-December in a particular year. A year of a particular city's changing temperature average will result in a unique melody and a unique montage of color. Perhaps I will create three distinct representations from the temperature data of New York City, Mexico City, and Shanghai. I plan to make a YouTube video playlist of whichever cities I end up choosing.

## Game
My game is similar to a maze, but it will challenge the user to memorize the basic rules of Western musical harmony. The game will challenge a user to get from "Point 1" to "Point 2" in a grid of letters A-G with sharps and flats, representing musical notes. The challenge is that the path that the user takes from Point 1 to Point 2 will test their knowledge of Western harmony. The user will be assigned a random gamepiece which could be any letter from Ab to G#, representing a musical key. An upper case letter gampepiece represents a major key and a lower case letter gamepiece represents a minor key. If assigned A, for example, that user is "the key of A Major" and must use the arrow keys to follow a path that includes only the notes in the key of A Major (A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, and G♯) to get from Point 1 to Point 2 in the grid. If a player assigned A attempts to get from Point 1 to Point 2 by crossing their gamepiece to a tile that is not in the key of A major, their gamepiece is transported back to Point 1 and they must start again. The game player is essentially tested in their knowledge of what notes are contained in a particular musical key. Can you get from Point 1 to Point 2 using only tiles of the notes that are in your assigned key? That is the challenge!

The four elements I created include a blue house, a blue sad face, a yellow balloon, and a yellow smiley face.
