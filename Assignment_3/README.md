# Project 1
## Narrative
My narrative will use sound, happy faces and sad faces to demonstrate the notion that in Western music theory, major key tonality is frequently associated with happy songs and minor key tonality is associated with sad songs. An example of a three-note major chord is C+E+G, while an example of a three-note minor chord is C+Eb+G. My narrative will depict faces responding to these two chords in order to illustrate to this simple concept the viewer that major=happy and minor=sad.
