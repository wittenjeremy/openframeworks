## About
My Weather API translation is now working perfectly. I've tried it during different weather scenarios and as a result, different audio files play. The YouTube video shows Bushwick when the windspeed was greater than 1 mile per hour, the temperature was 55 degrees, there was no rain, no clouds, and no storm. As a result of these conditions, the second audio file "BellDrums.wav" plays.
