# Project 1
My narrative is now complete with new audio spoken by Trump. The narrative now contains symbolism whereby the right wall represents Europe, the bottom wall represents Mexico, the left wall represents China and the top wall represents Canada. When Trump hits any of these walls, a corresponding quotation is played. The code now allows all four walls to move instead of just one. Additionally, I have included new audio files which adds to the plot/narrativity of the project. I would say my narrative is 90% complete.

# Project 2: Translation
My Weather API translation is now working perfectly. I've tried it during different weather scenarios and as a result, different audio files play. The YouTube video shows Bushwick when the windspeed was greater than 1 mile per hour, the temperature was 55 degrees, there was no rain, no clouds, and no storm. As a result of these conditions, the second audio file "BellDrums.wav" plays.
